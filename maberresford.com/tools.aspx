    <p>I&#39;ve used various IDEs and utilities to work through websites and code. Years on this page denote specific software editions, not the years I used them (ex. I used TFS v2013 from early 2015 through late 2016).</p>
    <p>IDEs & Editors</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Visual Studio v2008-2017</i>: This has been my bread and butter for many years. At home I use VS Community 2017 and I've been using it in various editions since VS 2008.</li>
        <li><i>SQL Server Management Studio v2008-2015</i>: Par for the course for any SQL work.</li>
        <li><i>Google Scripts</i>: While it's not a local IDE, it's a great platform for working with Google's web application ecosystem.</li>
        <li><i>Notepad++</i>: Please don't make me go back to normal Notepad.</li>
        <li><i>LINQPad</i>: Testing code snippets without having to use dummy projects is fantastic.</li>
        <li><i>Eclipse</i>: COBOL has been my most heavily used language in Eclipse despite first learning how to use it for Java.</li>
        <li><i>CANDE (DMSII)</i>: I can't say I enjoyed using CANDE to work with COBOL, but "uphill in the snow both ways" gives you a better appreciation for modern IDEs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project Management & Version Control</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Team Foundation Version Control</i>: I've used this for the past few years at work in an enterprise-level code base.</li>
        <li><i>Git</i>: This is my preferred version control for personal projects <a class="github" href="https://github.com/MarissaB">(check out my GitHub!)</a> and I've used it in combination with TFVC at work.</li>
        <li><i>Microsoft Dynamics CRM</i>: I used CRM primarily for searching related incidents and finding prior issues that customers reported.</li>
        <li><i>Team Foundation Server v2013-2015</i>: We used TFS heavily for tracking bugs, incidents, research, etc for incidents from a developer point of view. The Kanban board is fantastic in TFS 2015.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other Software</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>SoapUI</i>: I've used it for testing automation when providing application support, and I'm learning to create my own tests for personal projects.</li>
        <li><i>FileZilla</i>: Standard FTP client for personal projects.</li>
        <li><i>Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator</i>: I've designed banners and shirts for charity work as well as vehicle wrap designs for personal use.</li>
        <li><i>Microsoft Office (Word, Powerpoint, etc)</i>: Standard document processing that we all know and love.</li>
        <li><i>PortaTree Professional Ultimate Drag Race Timer (Gold Box)</i>: I'm not expecting to time quarter-mile drag races in an office, but if you need me to I can!</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="title2">What I've Done</p>
    <p>For the most part these are built with me as the only user in mind, but a few portions like my Google Scripts works are being used publicly. These are a mixture of random projects and general tinkering, and I'll never be properly "done" with any of them.</p>
    <ul class="nobullet"><li class="add">I'm still actively adding to this page!</li></ul>

    <p class="title2">DM Suite</p>
    <ul class="nobullet">
        <li class="info">A growing suite of tools for Dungeon Masters to manage content in Dungeons and Dragons.</li>
        <li class="folder">C#, UWP, SQLite3</li>
        <li class="git"><a class="github" href="https://github.com/MarissaB/DM-Suite">Check it out on GitHub!</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I enjoy running D&D games as a DM and wanted to spin up a creative project for the winter. It's also a fun time to play with the newest UWP controls.</p>

    <p class="title2">Game Inventory</p>
    <ul class="nobullet">
        <li class="info">A basic inventory program for tracking purchased video games as a collector.</li>
        <li class="folder">C#, Entity Framework, SQL/LINQ</li>
        <li class="git"><a class="github" href="https://github.com/MarissaB/GameInventory">Check it out on GitHub!</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I made this to better organize my collection of console and handheld video games. I'd worked with inventory systems when offloading trucks in retail, so I figured why not create a similar version to help my purchasing prowess.</p>

    <p class="title2">Google Script Tools</p>
    <ul class="nobullet">
        <li class="info">A small collection of useful tools I've put together in Google Scripts</li>
        <li class="folder">Google Apps Script (aka Javascript)</li>
        <li class="git"><a class="github" href="https://github.com/MarissaB/Google-Script-Tools">Check it out on GitHub!</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>While putting together the player rewards system for Paradox Comics-n-Cards, I learned a lot about Google's scripting ecosystem and created a couple of handy scripts that others can use. One is a script that will open and close a form automatically in sync with events on a Google calendar. Another is a script that will sync up the answer choices for individual questions on two different forms.</p>

    <p class="title2">Calculator</p>
    <ul class="nobullet">
        <li class="info">Basic calculator with GUI.</li>
        <li class="folder">C#, WPF</li>
        <li class="git"><a class="github" href="https://github.com/MarissaB/Calculator">Check it out on GitHub!</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Short and sweet, it's a standard calculator. I generally use this kind of project to figure out a new language and a calculator was one of the first GUI-based programs I ever wrote. I'd like to create some plug-ins for it to do cooking calculations and use some automotive formulas like calculating wheel dimensions.</p>

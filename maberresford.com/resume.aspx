    <p class="title2">In a nutshell.</p>
    <p><!--I'm working on my career in programming and system management, and I'm looking for a company with long-term potential and flexibility to let their devs grow with new technologies. I enjoy variety and new challenges.
        <br /><br />-->
        Originally I hail from Richmond, VA and moved to Fargo, ND in June 2014 after I graduated from college, so my experience is 'split' between non-technical work pre-college and more technical work post-college. I also have a tendency to pick up interesting side jobs, hence the overlapping timelines.

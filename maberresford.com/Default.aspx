    <p class="title1">I am a <b>programmer</b>.</p>
    <p>I enjoy <b>working</b> through code, building new projects, and <b>learning</b> better methods.</p>
    <p>I have my preferences and go-tos, but I enjoy picking up new ideas and tools for tinkering.</p>
    <p>That's how you find the cool, interesting stuff, right?</p>
    <p class="title2"><b>Front End</b>? Yes.</p>
    <p>Give me a clean, smooth <b>UI</b> any day. Efficient, engaged users are happy users, which leads to a happy system.</p>
    <p class="title2"><b>Back end</b>? Yes.</p>
    <p>Having a great front-end is useless if the back-end isn't designed with <b>future expansion</b> and proper maintenance in mind.</p>
    <p class="title2"><b>Networking</b>? Let's do it.</p>
    <p>I'm not an admin, but I've worked closely with networking teams and can read network mappings to help <b>troubleshoot</b> system issues. I look forward to learning even more.</p>
    <p class="title2"><b>System Support</b>? Done it.</p>
    <p>Keeping a fast work pace to go through incidents and <b>fix bugs</b> kept me on my toes for a few years.</p>
    <p class="title2"><b>Desktop Support</b>? Not my first choice.</p>
    <p>Like any computer nerd, I do enough basic IT support for my mother.</p>
